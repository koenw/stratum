          The known constant offset of this device (not including the PPS signal)

          After monitoring your situation for a bit you'll probably notice the

          signal, which you can configure here for extra clean output.

          The NTP Reference ID (refid) for this device

          In the NTP message the server returns to the client, this is a field
          that can be used by stratum 1 servers (like us) to indicate what
          their stratum 0 clock is. There is an authoritative list of Reference
          Identifiers maintained by IANA, see
          [here](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/info/ntp-refid.htm) for
          an overview.

          In addition to enabling clients to tell the source of their time, the
          refid can also be used to lock a PPS reference clock to another
          clock.

          This is the refid for the UART device which we will actually not
          broadcast to clients, so it doesn't matter that much what you set
          this to. Do keep in mind restrictions apply (e.g. only ascii, max 4
          chars).

          The NTP Reference ID (refid) of another reference clock to lock the
          PPS clock to.

          Because the PPS device only tells us the (quite exact) edge of a
          second but not what second that is, we need another clock source to
          be able to actually tell the time of day.

          This option allows us to "lock" the PPS signal to another refclock,
          adding the precision of the PPS signal to the more complete but
          (presumably) less accurate other refclock.

          The NTP Reference ID (refid) for the PPS clock.

          In the NTP response message this is a field that in the case of a

          If you've configured your GNSS receiver to only use a particular
          constellation, other values of interest might be *GOES*, *GPS* or
          *GAL*. The default value of *PPS* indicates a generic
          pulse-per-second refclock.

          Most GNSS devices will transmit data on the serial port before being
          talked to, making u-boot and the bootloader think the user pressed a
          keyboard button to interrupt autoboot.

          Because we'd like our device to boot without interaction we force the
          bootloader to not prompt the user. Because we override a generated
          config file, we take care to "fix" this everytime this file gets
          overwritten.

          Ideally we would fix this properly, so we can rely on the bootloader
          for fault-recovery.

        description = mdDoc ''
          In some cases a GNSS device can be deactived only to return a few
          seconds later (with some modules more than others). However, by this
          time gpsd has often already removed the device and because gpsd drops
          root priviliges after initialization it is unable to re-initialize
          the device.

          The proper solution would be to fix the issue of why your GPS
          module resets (faulty cabling, faulty module, another device
          using the same GPIO pins, etc).

          See  [this gpsd issue](https://gitlab.com/gpsd/gpsd/-/issues/211) for
          more details.

          This option will enable a watchdog that will monitor chrony & gpsd
          and restart gpsd when it detects that gpsd hasn't been forwarding the
          NMEA and PPS signals for a while.
